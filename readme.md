Basically, this is a question of expression. 

GENES are the information carriers of life. From my limited understanding of genetics, every strand of DNA is composed of 4 types of bases called nucleotides. The four pair together with exactly one other to form a pair, giving DNA its double-stranded structure. These pairs are: 
- A -> T or U 
- C -> G
For our purposes, the true names of these bases are irrelevant. Their pairings are fixed. Their sequence might be... Controlled? I can't recall but I seem to remember that a nucleotide of one variety can't be adjacent to the last... 

These base pairs arrange to form triads, called Codons. The Codons are almost all junk, at least in humans. But some of them are encodings that can create protons.
